# Tyler Harold
I enjoy working with PHP & C#. Occasionally I dive into Python, JavaScript, and Java. Most of my personal projects are for fun, and are not supposed to be taken to finish, so please don't hold a grudge if anything you star doesn't reach that point.

Feel free to contact me through my personal email: tyler@programmer.net
